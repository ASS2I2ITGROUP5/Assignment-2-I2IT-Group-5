Risks

Potential risks of this project can be difficulties in developing a user friendly interface, safety concern of the application users, how to relate accumulated points toward rewards and how the recycled items will be efficiently recycled and achieve the ultimately goal- reduce resources wastage.

Our potential user groups can range from teenagers to household owners to elderly people. Some of them may not be exposed to nowadays new technology or have little experience using mobile phone applications. How to develop a user friendly interface but also packed with all necessary functions is going to be a potential risk. In some case we may think the application is easy to operate, but it can be extremely difficult to those who barely use any mobile applications. Then they will starting thinking this application is not going to work, which will lead to a potential failure of this project.

In this project, we are to use reward points as encouragement to users to collect their recycled goods to reduce the wastage. But how we are going to make sure the users will get their reward points and also make reward points actually work. If this issue is not clarified, without the valid encouragement, they will loose the interests collecting recycle goods, which the project will be considered as failed.

How we can effectively making sure the recycled goods are being correctly handled is another issue worth to look at. The aim of this application is to raise public awareness of how recycling their goods will benefit not only the environment, but also themselves. Through they are used to sorted out waste and recycled goods will help reduce both resources and energy wasted during the production of new goods. If the recycled goods we collected from household are not effectively handled, that is away from our target, the idea and operation will be meaningless.
