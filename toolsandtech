"What software or other tools are required by the project? Are there any software licenses
needed? Is there any hardware needed (beyond a standard laptop or something similar)? This
needs to be precise (e.g. Windows Movie Maker Version 45.3) but needn't be long. You
should also include a brief description of any prior experience any group members have had
with the tools and technologies you list. There is no minimum length for this. It is important
to be as precise as possible, but descriptions of the tools are not needed here."

For the creation of 'Trashocated', powerful computing devices are required in order to efficiently develop for the iPhone
platform. iOS app development is completed with Xcode (10.0 version), an integrated development environment which 
not only includes a text based code editor (which requires code to be written in Swift 4.2), but also an intuitive design platform 
for mobile devices. Xcode is designed exclusively for devices running the OSX operating systems. And as Xcode is a relatively processor
intensive program, the minimum requirements in an OSX (running 10.16 Mojave) device for this purpose are baked within the 2018 MacBook 
Pro (RRP $1,899), which 
boasts 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, 8GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory, 
and a 128GB SSD. Along with that, in order to post the Trashocated application on Apple's App Store for download, a membership to the Apple
Development Program ($99) is required. This will only be required by one developer, and also will provide them access to beta software,
beta testing tools, and app analytics.
