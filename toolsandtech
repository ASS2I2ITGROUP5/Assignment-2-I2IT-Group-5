"What software or other tools are required by the project? Are there any software licenses
needed? Is there any hardware needed (beyond a standard laptop or something similar)? This
needs to be precise (e.g. Windows Movie Maker Version 45.3) but needn't be long. You
should also include a brief description of any prior experience any group members have had
with the tools and technologies you list. There is no minimum length for this. It is important
to be as precise as possible, but descriptions of the tools are not needed here."

For the creation of 'Trashocated', powerful computing devices are required in order to efficiently develop for both Android and iPhone
platforms.
