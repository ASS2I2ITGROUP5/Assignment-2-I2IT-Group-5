We will identify our user groups, start doing email survey to verify their needs, how they want the application to help them execute their task and how they want the reward points to work. Also by sending out survey hopefuly we can find our potential user who are interested in part of this project.

Then we use personas and context scenario working on our user interface key path. Develop a mock up or low fidelity prototype for the user to try out. Through interviews we can get the users to test the prototype, pointing out what we need to enhance on the application.

Based on the data we gather from the interviews, a high fidelity prototype will be developed, another interview can be held to determine if we are on the right path. If everything goes as expected, a beta version of application will be developed and will be tested internally by our tester to see if there is any of potential bug that will affect the application dramatically. Then we can post it onto app store for potential user to trial. Which will be awarded if they can provide valuable feedback.
